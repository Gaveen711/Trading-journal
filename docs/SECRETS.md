# Secrets and environment configuration

All server secrets live in Vercel environment variables. Nothing in this list
belongs in git, and nothing here may carry a `VITE_` prefix unless it is
genuinely public — Vite inlines every `VITE_*` variable into the client bundle.

`api/_security.ts#assertRequiredConfig` logs any missing entry at cold start, so
check the function logs after a deploy or a rotation.

## Required

| Variable | Used by | Effect if missing |
|---|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | all Firestore access | API cannot reach the database |
| `CRON_SECRET` | `/api/cron/*` | **Cron routes refuse to run (503).** Must be ≥32 characters |
| `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `/api/lemon-squeezy-webhook` | Webhook returns 500; subscriptions stop updating |
| `METAAPI_TOKEN` | broker sync | Broker connect and sync fail |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | transactional mail | Mail silently fails (errors are logged) |

## Recommended

| Variable | Used by | Effect if missing |
|---|---|---|
| `RECAPTCHA_API_KEY` | `/api/contact` | Bot protection is not enforced; a warning is logged per request |
| `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | reCAPTCHA assessment | As above. Public value — safe to expose |
| `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` | `api/_auth.ts` | Enforcement of verified email on broker and API-key routes. **On by default** and safe to leave on: only accounts created after this shipped are gated (they carry a server-set `requiresEmailVerification` flag set by `/init-user`), so accounts that predate verification are grandfathered and never locked out mid-subscription. Google sign-ins are always verified. Set to the string `false` to disable entirely |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | CORS | Extra allowed origin. `localhost:5173` is added automatically outside production |

## Public (`VITE_*`, inlined into the client bundle)

`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`,
`VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`,
`VITE_LEMON_SQUEEZY_CHECKOUT_URL_MONTHLY`, `VITE_LEMON_SQUEEZY_CHECKOUT_URL_YEARLY`,
`VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`.

Firebase web config values are public by design — access control is enforced by
`firestore.rules` and `storage.rules`, not by hiding the API key.

## Rotation

```bash
# Set or rotate a value, then redeploy so functions pick it up.
vercel env rm CRON_SECRET production
vercel env add CRON_SECRET production
vercel --prod
```

Generate a strong `CRON_SECRET`:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

After rotating `METAAPI_TOKEN`, revoke the old one at
[MetaApi → API access](https://app.metaapi.cloud/api-access/generate-token).

## Local development

`.env.local` at the repo root is gitignored and holds the same names. Pull the
current values rather than keeping a long-lived copy on disk:

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local
```

The workstation holding this file has a full Firebase service-account private
key on it — make sure it has full-disk encryption.

## Console-side configuration

Not everything is an environment variable. These are set in the Firebase
console and are part of the security posture:

- **App Check** with reCAPTCHA Enterprise, enforced on Authentication,
  Firestore, and Storage. This is the only control that covers the direct
  browser-to-Google auth path, which the Vercel rate limiter never sees.
- **Email enumeration protection** and a password policy (minimum 12
  characters) under Authentication → Settings.
- **Multi-factor authentication** for any account holding the `admin` custom
  claim, and for Pro accounts.
- **TTL policy** on the `webhookEvents` collection (90 days) so the replay
  ledger does not grow without bound.

## Admin access

Admin is a custom claim, not a hardcoded UID:

```bash
node -e "
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp({ credential: admin.credential.cert(require('./service-account.json')) });
admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims('<uid>', { admin: true }).then(() => console.log('done'));
"
```

The claim takes effect on the user's next token refresh. Revoke by setting
`{ admin: false }`. Enforce MFA on every account that holds it.

## Broker credentials

Broker MT4/MT5 passwords are never stored server-side, and are never written to
`localStorage`. See `src/lib/brokerCredentials.js` for the storage split and the
reasoning.

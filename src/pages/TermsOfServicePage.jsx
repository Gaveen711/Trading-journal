You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately at info@xaujournal.com if you suspect unauthorized access.

Subscriptions auto-renew each billing cycle unless cancelled before the renewal date. You may cancel at any time via the billing portal in your account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain Pro access until then.

xaujournal offers a 7-day money-back guarantee on your first Pro subscription payment. If you are not satisfied within 7 days of your initial purchase, contact us at info@xaujournal.com for a full refund. Renewal charges are non-refundable.

    content: `xaujournal supports optional trade synchronisation via the Meta API — the industry-standard protocol used by MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5) compatible brokers. By connecting your broker account through this feature, you authorise xaujournal to establish a read-only connection to your broker's trade history using a secure token issued through the Meta API protocol.

The Meta API connection is provided for personal use only. You may not share, transfer, or use another person's broker credentials to connect to xaujournal.

You are responsible for keeping your xaujournal account secure and for any activity resulting from your broker connection. We are not liable for any trading losses, broker actions, account restrictions, or data exposure resulting from your use of the Meta API connection or the misuse of your account credentials.

The Meta API connection feature is provided as-is. We make no warranty that it will be compatible with all brokers, MT4/MT5 server versions, or broker configurations. You may revoke the broker connection at any time from your account settings, which will immediately terminate our access to your broker data.

xaujournal is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for MetaQuotes Software Corp., any MetaTrader platform, or any broker you choose to connect.`,
